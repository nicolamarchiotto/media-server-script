## Radarr and Sonarr

To be set on web interface:
- Set client torrent as qbittorrent, address is localhost:8080, set your qbittorrent installation credentials
- Set indexers using jackett, settings -> indexers -> add -> torznab
  get the url clicking the _copy torznab feed_ of your jackett entries
  api key is the jackett api key
  set categories accordingly to the indexer
- For **Sonarr**, exploit custom formats to automatically retrieve episode with **subtitles**
  - create the following custom formats, each one must have a required condition on the release title, the string to be matched are the following
  - the regular expression should be \bstring2bematched\b
    - multi-subs          
    - multi-sub           
    - multi sub   
    - multi subs          
    - multiple subtitles          
    - multiple subtitle  
    - sub ita             
    - sub eng             
    - sub
    - subs                 
  - On the _Profile_ section, create a new profile HD-1080p-subs starting from the HD-1080p one
    - Assign to each custom format previously created a score of 10
    - Set the Minimum Custom Format Score as 10
  - When adding a new serie, set as quality profile _HD-1080p-subs_
  - **Select Series Type, anime if anime, standard if tv shows, if not, correct episodes may not be found**
  
- For **Radarr** do not use custom profiles, for each movie do a search and manually select the version to download, it's easier
