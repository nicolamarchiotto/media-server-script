## install.sh

To change the port configuration, do not edit the docker-compose.yml file directly. Edit the .env file instead. Be carefull to not introduce new lines in the .env file

The install.sh script perform the following actions

- Install openssh-server if not already installed on the system
- Install docker engine
- runs the edit edit_homer_config.py python script, install PyYAML as prerequisites
  - The script retrieve the docker condfiguration from the .env file and edits the Homer config.yml file accordingly
- create a service which will **automatically turnoff the system at 01:30 am**, might need to reboot manually to apply the changes
- creates all the containers from the docker-compose.yml

## uninstall.sh


To uninstall run unistall.sh, docker and shh will be removed

## HW setup
- Script was tested with ubunru 22.04.03 LTS server
- Docker engine and ssh can be installed directly via the ubuntu installer
- Run on system with intel i5 8th gen, 8 Gb of ram, 256GB ssd for hosting the system, 1TB of hdd for media
- Space required for whole installation is 20 GB

# Setup notes

## Homer

Web UI for quickly access the server services. If the .env variable DNS_ENTRY is set, the link will redirect to DNS_ENTRY:SERVICE_PORT. If not, the link will point to IP:SERVICE_PORT

To set your local dns, use Pihole, further instructions below.

## Radarr and Sonarr

To be set on web interface:
- Set client torrent as qbittorrent, address is localhost:8080, set your qbittorrent installation credentials
- Set indexers using jackett, settings -> indexers -> add -> torznab
  get the url clicking the _copy torznab feed_ of your jackett entries
  api key is the jackett api key
  set categories accordingly to the indexer
- For **Sonarr**, exploit custom formats to automatically retrieve episode with **subtitles**
  - create the following custom formats, each one must have a required condition on the release title, the string to be matched are the following
  - the regular expression should be \bstring2bematched\b
    - multi-subs          
    - multi-sub           
    - multi sub   
    - multi subs          
    - multiple subtitles

    - sub eng             
    - sub
    - subs                 
  - On the _Profile_ section, create a new profile HD-1080p-subs starting from the HD-1080p one
    - Assign to each custom format previously created a score of 10
    - Set the Minimum Custom Format Score as 10
  - When adding a new serie, set as quality profile _HD-1080p-subs_
  - **Select Series Type, anime if anime, standard if tv shows, if not, correct episodes may not be found**
  
- For **Radarr** do not use custom profiles, for each movie do a search and manually select the version to download, it's easier
